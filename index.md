# Welcome to the CloudBank Solution: *Burnop*

This CloudBank Solution describes five basic measures that can help you optimize your cloud spend (or *burn rate*). 
The cost comparisons given below are hypothetical to provide a sense of scale.


* Use pre-emptible instances, cost $0.30 in comparison with $1.00
* Ensure you are not being charged indirect cost overhead on your cloud spend, cost $1.00 in comparison with $1.50
* Check your compute task usage using a CPU monitoring utility such as **`top`**, cost $1.00 in comparison with $8.00
* Use an automatic **`Stop`** utility on your Virtual Machines, cost $1.00 in comparison with $3.00
* Guard against committing your keys to public locations such as GitHub, cost $1.00 in comparison with $15,000.00


Each of these cost-saving measures is covered below: We have tried to indicate both why there is a cost savings
to you the researcher as well as what the learning process is like to successfully use these strategies.
